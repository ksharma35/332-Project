# 332-Project
  This was a school group project that I took part in. For the project I had to develop an optimization algortihm in R that used 
Reinforcement Learning to determine the best path that mobile and fixed air quality sensors should take to effectively cover
any region given a budget.

  I used a simmulated annealing algorithm to determine the initial placement of the sensors in the region. The output of the algorithm was
  written to a database that was also created as a part of this project usuing MySQL.
